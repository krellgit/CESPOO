, an award-winning beauty brand, checked all the boxes.
But, they were still buried deep in the rankings.

That’s when they changed how shoppers discovered them - by hyper-focusing on demand, not hacks.

Partnering with Levanta, the brand doubled down on vetted publishers, creators and affiliates that sent qualified, high-intent traffic directly to Amazon. When those clicks converted, Amazon rewarded them.

The impact:
 • $350,000+ in affiliate-driven sales
 • BSR soared from #520 to #28 in Beauty & Personal Care
 • 362,384 external product clicks
The momentum drove revenue and visibility. Most brands stop short of seeing which clicks improve ra...

Subject: This AMC trick slashed ACoS 40%
From: Chris Rawlings <chris@sophiesociety.com>
Date: Thu, 5 Feb 2026 15:01:23 +0000 (GMT)

Body:
With guardrails for video adsMost people think running Amazon ads is basically picking your poison…

You choose Option A where you pick every keyword yourself (takes forever + gets messy fast).

Or Option B where you let Amazon go “automatic” (then it blows money on a bunch of searches that never get buys).

But we tried a third way where we let Amazon do the picking but keep it on a tight leash.

Instead of telling Amazon exactly what words to show up for we used the setting that basically says “show this video ad on searches related to my product page”.

Thats usually risky because Amazon tends to get a bit too creative and starts showing you for random stuff which obviously isnt good for your clicks or budget.

So we added a filter.

We used Amazon’s audience tool to build a “likely buyers” group based on searches that already made us money in the past. Then we told Amazon to run broad but bid higher if the shopper matches this proven buyer group.

(Basically we were...
